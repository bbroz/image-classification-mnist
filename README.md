__Abstract/Motivation:__

To learn to and showcase the training, testing and validation of an image classification model using several machline learning algorithms. 

__Dataset:__

The widely used [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) database, containing 60,000 training images taken from the American Census Bureau and 10,000 testing images taken from American high school students of handwritten digits from 0-9.

__Machline Learning Algorithms:__

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Nearest Neighbor
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- XGBoost
- Random Forest

__Quantitative Assessments:__

In order to assess, compare and track performance of machine learning algorithms, the following metrics will be used:

- Accuracy Score
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
